# McGillCourseSeatsTimeline
VSB Scraper to get seats available for a list of courses
--
The goal is to create a historical chart (updated daily or more regularly in the first days of registration) in order to see the rate at which different courses at McGill fill up. This would enable students to have an idea of how much in advance they should register for a course, if a course usually fills up, or if during add-drop period some seats get available, ect...

This is still in development
